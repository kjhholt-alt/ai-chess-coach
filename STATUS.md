# Project Status

## Quick Status
- **Project:** AI Chess Coach
- **Current session:** 10 of 10 (Sessions 1-9 complete)
- **Last updated:** 2026-02-12
- **Overall health:** 🟢 Feature-complete for beta — 131 tests passing, zero TS errors

---

## What's Working
- Landing page with dark emerald theme, glassmorphism, hero section, features, waitlist
- Responsive Navbar with auth-aware navigation
- **Playable chess game** — full AI opponent (minimax + alpha-beta pruning), PvP mode, 3 difficulty levels, undo, resign, save/resume to localStorage
- **PlayableChessBoard** — click-to-move + drag-and-drop, legal move highlighting, promotion UI, check highlighting
- **Chess engine** — minimax at configurable depth, piece-square tables, material counting
- **Game import** — fetch games from Lichess API, parse NDJSON, save to localStorage
- **Game viewer** — interactive board with move-by-move replay, keyboard navigation
- **Game analysis** — client-side analysis engine (depth 4 minimax), move classification (brilliant/great/good/inaccuracy/mistake/blunder), accuracy calculation, evaluation graph
- **AI coaching** — Claude API integration for post-game coaching feedback (via /api/coach)
- **AI game analysis** — Claude API integration for multi-game pattern analysis (via /api/analyze)
- **Puzzle trainer** — 3 modes (Daily 5, Endless, Theme-based), 60 curated puzzles, Elo rating tracking, hints, session tracking
- **Opening explorer** — Lichess opening database integration, interactive board, win/draw/loss percentages, AI opening advice
- **Repertoire builder** — add lines, quiz mode, move tree visualization, accuracy tracking
- **Dashboard** — game stats, accuracy trends, weakness radar, training streaks
- **Progress tracking** — stat cards, accuracy trend chart, mistakes per game, theme mastery, puzzle rating history
- **Achievements** — 28 achievement definitions, automatic unlock checking
- **Game history** — browsable list with win/loss/draw filter, links to analysis
- **Waitlist API** — email signup with validation and rate limiting
- TypeScript compiles clean (zero errors)

## What's NOT Working / Incomplete
- `next build` hangs on this machine due to stale Node processes consuming memory — **needs machine restart**
- Auth pages not created (sign-in / verify-request) — app works without auth for free beta
- No Stripe payments (intentionally skipped for beta)
- GameOverModal component IS connected in play page (confirmed at line 833)

---

## Last Session Summary
**Date:** 2026-02-12 (Session 7 — Testing)
**Goal:** Comprehensive test suite + code quality cleanup
**What got done:**
- Created 5 new test files: chess-engine (9 tests), game-storage (19), puzzle-bank (22), analysis-engine (6), api-coach (15)
- Fixed chess-engine test flakiness (beginner AI has 40% random moves, can't reliably find mate)
- Removed all `as any` type casts from Navbar and Puzzles pages
- Added proper NavLink interface for typed nav links
- Imported Move type from chess.js in puzzles page
- Confirmed GameOverModal IS used in play page (line 833) — previous report was wrong
- Full suite: **11 test files, 131 tests, 100% pass rate**
- TypeScript: zero errors

**Test Coverage:**
| File | Tests | Coverage |
|------|-------|----------|
| chess-engine.ts | 9 | Material counting, captured pieces, AI moves |
| analysis-engine.ts | 6 | Position evaluation, game analysis, progress callback |
| game-storage.ts | 19 | CRUD, in-progress game, expiry, puzzle stats, user profile |
| puzzle-bank.ts | 22 | Bank validation, theme filtering, rating calc (Elo K=32) |
| lichess.ts | 17 | Game fetching, NDJSON parsing, error handling |
| rate-limit.ts | 6 | Sliding window, cleanup, reset |
| api-analyze | 10 | Validation, rate limiting, Claude mock, JSON parsing |
| api-coach | 15 | Validation, rate limiting, Claude mock, error handling |
| api-games | 11 | Lichess proxy, validation, error handling |
| api-puzzles | 5 | Daily puzzle, fallback, error handling |
| api-waitlist | 11 | Email validation, rate limiting, normalization |

## Next Session Plan
**Goal:** Session 10 — Deployment to Vercel
**What to do:**
- Restart machine (clear stale Node processes)
- Run `next build` to verify production build
- Deploy to Vercel
- Configure environment variables (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL)
- Verify deployment works end-to-end
- Final polish if needed

## Architecture Decisions Log
| Date | Decision | Why | Alternative Considered |
|------|----------|-----|----------------------|
| 2026-02-10 | Lichess API over chess.com | Free, well-documented API, no auth needed | chess.com API (requires OAuth) |
| 2026-02-10 | Dark emerald theme | Distinctive look, chess/green association | Indigo/blue theme |
| 2026-02-10 | Skip Stripe for beta | Launch faster, validate demand | Build payments now |
| 2026-02-11 | Minimax AI over Stockfish | Simpler, no WASM complexity, good enough for casual players | Stockfish WASM (heavy, complex integration) |
| 2026-02-11 | Client-side analysis | No server load, instant results, works offline | Server-side Stockfish (better but complex) |
| 2026-02-11 | localStorage persistence | No database needed for MVP, fast, works offline | PostgreSQL/Prisma (overkill for MVP) |

---

## Environment Notes
- **OS:** Windows 11 + Git Bash
- **Node version:** 20+
- **Deploy target:** Vercel
- **Database:** None (localStorage for MVP)
- **Key API keys needed:** ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL
- **Known env quirks:** `next build` hangs with 50+ Node processes. Use `taskkill //F //IM node.exe` or restart machine.
